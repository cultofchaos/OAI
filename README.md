OpenAI Source Code Leaked


Oh, and if you're looking for documentation, good luck finding any! too busy writing papers and giving talks to bother documenting my code. You're on your own! ðŸ‘‹

Contributions are welcome

So go ahead, fork this repository, waste your time trying to understand my terrible code, and then realize that you'd be better off starting from scratch yourself. It's the OpenAI way!
